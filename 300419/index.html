		<h1>I Belong Here</h1>
		<p>There is no act of forgiveness,<br>
			only the redeeming light on<br>
			the shoulders dancing in<br>
			tall weeds, cigarettes gone<br>
			and the girls slapping free.<br>
			The tortilla cart burns against<br>
			the wall because Jesus called<br>
			my brother who was acquired<br>
			by whistling gangs of men<br>
			under the hanging arch<br>
			There can be no night without<br>
			the wind on shoulders exhausted<br>
			by games and messages my brother<br>
			lost between the darkness and<br>
			the bridge into Juarez, Mexico,<br>
			where no crows caw because<br>
			the buildings are torn and<br>
			flashlights are narrow in<br>
			their beaming stumble,<br>
			my thoughts the last ones<br>
			on this side of the river,<br>
            my sudden happiness hidden<br>
			in celestial light without being<br>
			appalled at what I see, my ears<br>
			to the ground listening to weeds<br>
			overrun by boys who can’t spell<br>
			and are waiting for me without<br>
			knowing pilgrims are on the border.<br>
            Whatever kills them spares me<br>
			the journey to beg for purity<br>
			among unspoken Spanish<br>
			everyone fears in their greed.<br>
			The group doesn’t know it is<br>
			what the river stones teach,<br>
			though I can’t speak of them<br>
            because faith is prehistoric and<br>
			my brother is pursued by dust<br>
			storms that erase his footprints<br>
			across the back roads where he<br>
			loses his language of need.<br>
